# Family Code Guide - How to Find and Share Your Family Code

## Where to Find Your Family Code

### Method 1: After Creating a Family
1. When you create a family as a parent, you should see a screen with the family code
2. The code will be displayed in large, bold text
3. Copy this code and share it with your child

### Method 2: From Parent Dashboard
1. After logging in as a parent, go to your dashboard
2. Look for the "Family Code" section
3. Click "Show Code" to reveal your family code
4. The code will appear in a dashed box

## How to Share the Code

### For Parents:
1. **Copy the code** from the app
2. **Share it with your child** via:
   - Text message
   - Email
   - Write it down on paper
   - Tell them verbally

### For Children:
1. **Get the code** from your parent
2. **Open the app** and sign in
3. **Select "Child"** as your role
4. **Enter the family code** when prompted
5. **Join the family** and start receiving tasks!

## Troubleshooting

### If You Don't See the Family Code:

1. **Check Firebase Rules**: Make sure you've updated your Firebase Security Rules (see FIREBASE-SETUP-GUIDE.md)

2. **Refresh the App**: Try refreshing the page or restarting the app

3. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for any error messages

4. **Verify Family Creation**: Make sure the family was created successfully by checking the Firebase Console

### If the Code Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Spelling**: Make sure the code is entered exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
2. **Check Timing**: The code should be entered soon after the family is created
3. **Try Again**: Sometimes there's a delay - wait a few seconds and try again

## Code Format

Family codes are:
- **6 characters long**
- **Uppercase letters and numbers**
- **Example**: `ABC123`, `XYZ789`, `DEF456`

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify your Firebase setup** is correct
3. **Make sure you're using the right role** (parent vs child)
4. **Try creating a new family** if the current one isn't working

## Quick Test

To test if everything is working:
1. Create a family as a parent
2. Note down the family code
3. Sign out and sign in as a child
4. Try joining with the family code
5. If it works, you're all set!
